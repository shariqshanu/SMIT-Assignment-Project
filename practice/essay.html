        <h1>My Visit to Dubai</h1>

        <p>
            On 19<sup>th</sup> Oct 2025, I went to <strong>Dubai</strong>. The city was very beautiful, and tall buildings were visible everywhere. The most amazing place I saw was the <b>Burj Khalifa</b>. <br>
            When I reached the top, it felt like I was above the clouds. <br><br>

            The outside air was completely fresh, just like O<sub>2</sub>. I took many pictures. Under one picture, I wrote: <br><br>

            <strong>Pakistan Zindabad</strong> <br><br>

            Because even while traveling the world, my love for <b><i>Pakistan</i></b> always remains.

        <p>
            I met a tourist from <strong>India</strong>. He told me that their team had <s>won</s> actually lost. He also told me that he used to be the <del>Test Captain</del>, but now he is the <ins>Director of Cricket</ins>.

            5, 9 Street. Suburb/City: Muwailih, Sharjah
        </address>

        <p>
            His uncle, <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Ali, welcomed me warmly. His wife, <abbr title="Mistress">Mrs.</abbr> Ali, served tea and snacks. <br><br>

            There, I also met some students from 
            <abbr title="Saylani Mass IT Training">SMIT</abbr> 
            who were applying for jobs in the 
            <abbr title="United Arab Emirates">UAE</abbr>. 
        </p>

        <h4>I remembered a famous quote:</h4>
        <q>There is no power which can undo Pakistan</q>

        <p>
            <em>
                My trip to Dubai was memorable for me. <br>
                The city lights, the tall buildings, meeting new people—everything taught me something new.
